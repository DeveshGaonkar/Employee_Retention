## Introduction

Welcome to the AI Variant Data Analyst Internship Project: Employee Retention! This project was completed during an internship at AI Variant after completing the Data Analyst course at ExcelR. The project revolves around HR Analytics and focuses on analyzing employee retention using two datasets, HR_1 and HR_2, each containing 50,000 records.

## Project Overview

- **Domain:** `HR Analytics`
- **Project Name:** `Employee Retention`
- **Dataset Names:** `HR_1 & HR_2`
- **Dataset Type:** `Excel Data`
- **Dataset Size:** `50,000 records each`

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The project emphasizes six key performance indicators (KPIs) to gain insights into employee retention and related factors:

1. Average Attrition rate for all Departments.
2. Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist.
3. Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats.
4. Average working years for each Department.
5. Job Role Vs Work life balance.
6. Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Data Sources

The HR dataset was initially imported into an SQL database to centralize the data source.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

The dataset in the SQL database underwent thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, data type conversions, and duplicate removal, to prepare it for analysis in Power BI and Tableau.

## Dashboard Creation

## SQL Queries and Data Analysis

### Data Import into SQL

The HR dataset was imported into an SQL database, serving as the primary data source for both Power BI and Tableau dashboards.

### Purpose of SQL Queries

SQL queries played a crucial role in extracting and analyzing data for the key performance indicators (KPIs).

### KPI 1: Average Attrition rate for all Departments

**SQL Query:**
```sql
    CREATE VIEW KPI1 AS
	SELECT 
			Department,
			 
    ROUND((AVG((Attrition_Count)/(EmployeeCount))*100),2) as Avg_Attrition_Rate
	FROM 
			hr_1
	GROUP BY 
			Department
	ORDER BY 
			Avg_Attrition_Rate DESC;
```
**SQL Query to Print:**

```sql
	 #USING VIEWS FOR KPI 1
    SELECT * FROM KPI1;
```

### KPI 2: Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist

**SQL Query:**

```sql
    CREATE VIEW KPI2 AS 
    SELECT 
			JobRole,
			Gender,
			ROUND(AVG(HourlyRate),2) as Avg_HourlyRate
	FROM
			hr_1
	WHERE
			Gender = "Male" AND JobRole = 'Research Scientist';
```

**SQL Query to Print:**

```sql
	 #USING VIEWS FOR KPI 2
     SELECT * FROM KPI2;
```
