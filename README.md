## Introduction

Welcome to the AI Variant Data Analyst Internship Project: Employee Retention! This project was completed during an internship at AI Variant after completing the Data Analyst course at ExcelR. The project revolves around HR Analytics and focuses on analyzing employee retention using two datasets, HR_1 and HR_2, each containing 50,000 records.

## Project Overview

- **Domain:** HR Analytics
- **Project Name:** Employee Retention
- **Dataset Names:** HR_1 & HR_2
- **Dataset Type:** Excel Data
- **Dataset Size:** 50,000 records each

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The project emphasizes six key performance indicators (KPIs) to gain insights into employee retention and related factors:

1. Average Attrition rate for all Departments.
2. Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist.
3. Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats.
4. Average working years for each Department.
5. Job Role Vs Work life balance.
6. Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Data Sources

The HR dataset was initially imported into an SQL database to centralize the data source.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

The dataset in the SQL database underwent thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, data type conversions, and duplicate removal, to prepare it for analysis in Power BI and Tableau.

## Dashboard Creation

### Excel Dashboard
The Excel dashboard provides a clear and organized platform for visualizing critical HR Analytics insights. It utilizes various data visualization components such as charts, graphs, and PivotTables to represent key performance indicators (KPIs) effectively. User-friendly features like dropdown menus, data filtering, and dynamic updates enhance the user experience.

### Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard offers an immersive and interactive data exploration experience, allowing users to uncover insights and trends within the HR dataset. Its intuitive layout balances visualizations and filtering options, ensuring clarity and responsiveness. Features like slicers and cross-filtering enable users to interactively filter data and achieve instant updates across visuals.

### Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard provides an interactive platform for in-depth HR Analytics, facilitating a deeper understanding of employee retention patterns. Its modern design integrates a variety of data visualization components, including  bar charts, and more, to depict KPIs. Users can interact with filters to dynamically adjust visualizations and explore correlations.

## SQL Queries and Data Analysis

### Data Import into SQL

The HR dataset was imported into an SQL database, serving as the primary data source for both Power BI and Tableau dashboards.

### Purpose of SQL Queries

SQL queries played a crucial role in extracting and analyzing data for the key performance indicators (KPIs).

### SQL Code and Explanation

Each SQL query's code is designed to calculate specific metrics, and the accompanying explanation provides clarity on the logic applied within the project's context.

### Insights from SQL Analysis

The SQL analysis reveals insights into employee attrition, hourly rates, income statistics, working years, job roles, and their impact on employee retention.

## Usage Instructions

- Clone the project repository using the command: `git clone [repository URL]`.
- Ensure the Excel datasets (HR_1.xlsx and HR_2.xlsx) are available in the designated folders.
- Open the respective dashboard tools (Excel, Power BI, Tableau) and link the datasets to your project.
- Access and interact with the dashboards to explore HR Analytics insights.
- Run SQL queries in your SQL environment to analyze the data further.

## Conclusion

### Project Summary

This project successfully analyzed employee retention using HR Analytics. It created interactive dashboards and utilized SQL queries to gain insights into key performance indicators.

### Achievements and Insights

The project revealed valuable insights related to attrition rates, hourly rates, income statistics, working years, job roles, and their impact on employee retention.

### Lessons Learned

Challenges included data preprocessing and tool-specific nuances. The project underscored the importance of clear visualization design and thorough data understanding for meaningful analysis.

### Future Enhancements

Future work could involve predictive modeling for employee retention, advanced SQL analysis, or integration with live HR data sources for real-time insights.
